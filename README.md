Playing around and trying to learn Functional Programming in TypeScript/JavaScript. Experimenting with the [Funkia](https://github.com/funkia) libraries.

## Usage
Clone repository and run `npm install`

## io-fetch

Use [Jabz IO](https://github.com/Funkia/jabz/blob/master/docs/io-tutorial.md) with fetch to retrieve data from [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

### Run
`npm run io-fetch`

## showIndexPage

Took some code from [this JavaScript functional programming article](https://medium.com/@rajaraodv/functional-programming-in-js-with-practical-examples-part-1-87c2b0dbc276#.y98omytwd) which was using Ramda tried converting it to TypeScript and [Jabz](https://github.com/Funkia/jabz).

### Run
`npm run showIndexPage:ramda`
`npm run showIndexPage:jabz`
